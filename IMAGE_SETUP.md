# Image Setup Instructions

## 1. Supabase Storage Setup

### Create Storage Bucket
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage > Buckets
3. Click "Create a new bucket"
4. Name: `word-images`
5. Make it public: âœ… (so images can be accessed by students)
6. Click "Create bucket"

### Set Storage Policies
1. Go to Storage > Policies
2. Create a new policy for `word-images` bucket:

**Policy Name:** `Allow authenticated users to upload images`
**Policy Definition:**
```sql
((auth.role() = 'authenticated'::text) AND (bucket_id = 'word-images'::text))
```

**Policy Name:** `Allow public access to view images`
**Policy Definition:**
```sql
(bucket_id = 'word-images'::text)
```

## 2. Unsplash API Setup (Optional)

### Get API Key
1. Go to https://unsplash.com/developers
2. Create a new application
3. Get your Access Key
4. Add to your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
```

### Without API Key
If you don't set up Unsplash API, teachers can still upload their own images using the upload feature.

## 3. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Supabase (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Unsplash API (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key
```

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Images not showing:

- Check browser console for errors

### Upload not working:
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Check file size (should be reasonable)
- Verify file type is image (jpg, png, gif, etc.)

- Verify API key has proper permissions
- Check rate limits (Unsplash has daily limits)
