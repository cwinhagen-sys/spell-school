Max is scratching at your bedroom door. You hear his whining and get out of bed. It is Saturday morning, and Mom left early for work. Before she left, she told you: 'Max is all yours today! Make sure he has everything he needs.' Max looks at you with big, hopeful eyes. His tail wags slowly. You know he needs food, water, exercise, and attention. You have helped Mom with Max before, but today you are in charge of everything.

You find a note on the kitchen table. It says: 'Max's schedule: 1) Morning walk (30 minutes), 2) Breakfast (one cup of food), 3) Fresh water, 4) Playtime in the afternoon, 5) Evening walk before dinner.' The note is clear and easy to follow. You feel ready to take good care of Max. You should start with the first item on the list.

You try to remember what Mom does every morning. She always takes Max outside first... but you cannot remember if it is before or after breakfast. She gives him food, but how much? One cup or two? You are not sure about the exact times. Max is looking at you, waiting. You wish you had paid more attention. Maybe there is a note somewhere with the exact schedule?

You rush to the kitchen and pour food into Max's bowl. You give him a lot because he looks very hungry. But wait - the schedule said 'one cup of food' for breakfast, and you did not measure. Max eats quickly, but then he starts whining. He keeps looking at the door. You realize he needs to go outside, but you fed him too much too fast. Max looks uncomfortable. Maybe you should have started with the walk first, like the schedule said.

You put Max's leash on and take him outside. The morning air is fresh. Max is excited and pulls a little, but you hold the leash firmly. You walk around the neighborhood.

When you get home, Max looks happy and relaxed. According to the schedule, breakfast is next.

You measure one cup of dog food, just like the schedule says. You pour it into Max's clean bowl. You also fill his water bowl with fresh, clean water. Max eats slowly and drinks water. He looks satisfied. You remember the schedule said 'Fresh water' as number 3, and you just did that. You also remember to check his water bowl during the day. It is still morning, so you have time to do the other things on the schedule later.

You quickly measure one cup of food and give it to Max. He eats it all very fast. He was really hungry! After eating, Max seems a little better, but he still looks tired.

It is almost time for the evening walk.
